# Online Piggy Bank â€“ React Frontend Application

## Project Overview

This is a simple frontend web application that simulates an Online Piggy Bank.  
Users can add money into the piggy bank, view all deposit transactions, break the piggy bank to withdraw all funds, and start a new piggy bank once the previous one is broken.  

This app is designed as a single page React application with all data mocked and managed on the frontend without any backend.

## Features

- Add money to the current piggy bank.
- View all transactions (with timestamps and amounts).
- Break the piggy bank to withdraw all saved money.
- Start a new piggy bank only after the previous one is broken.
- Only one active piggy bank at a time.
- Friendly piggy bank icons added for visual cues.
- Clean component-based UI structure.
- Styling with CSS Modules.
